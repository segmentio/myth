# Myth

  _CSS the way it was imagined._

  Myth is a postprocessor that lets you write pure CSS without having to worry about slow browser support, or even slow spec approval. It's a like CSS polyfill.

## Installation

    $ npm install -g myth

## Why?

  Myth lets you write pure CSS while still giving you the benefits of tools like LESS and Sass. You can still use variables and math functions, just like you do in preprocessors. It's like a polyfill for future versions of the spec.

  Some of the features in CSS require runtime calculations, which neither Myth nor preprocessors handle, but what Myth does is let you write your code today in the future syntax, so that your code is future-proof. When browsers finally support these features you won't need to rewrite anything, just start using the cascade!

  Taking plain CSS as an input also means you can use Myth to <em>post-process</em> anyone else's CSS (or another preprocessors output), adding the browser support you need, without having to re-write the code in a completely different syntax.

  Myth is built with <a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/rework">Rework</a> so it's incredibly fast, and has a nice Javascript API in addition to the CLI.

## Example

  An example is the easiest way to explain it. If you write spec-compliant CSS:

```css
:root {
  var-green: #a6c776;
}

a {
  color: var(green);
  font-variant: all-small-caps;
  transition: color 1s;
}

a:hover {
  color: color(var(green) shade(20%));
}

::placeholder {
  opacity: .4;
  transition: opacity 1s;
}

:focus::placeholder {
  opacity: .2;
}
```

  ... Myth will transform it for you, into browser-compliant CSS:

```css
:root {
  var-green: #a6c776;
}

a {
  color: #a6c776;
  -webkit-font-feature-settings: "smcp", "c2sc";
  -moz-font-feature-settings: "smcp", "c2sc";
  font-feature-settings: "smcp", "c2sc";
  font-variant-caps: all-small-caps;
  -webkit-transition: color 1s;
  transition: color 1s;
}

a:hover {
  color: rgb(133, 159, 94);
}

::-moz-placeholder {
  opacity: .4;
  transition: opacity 1s;
}

:-ms-input-placeholder {
  opacity: .4;
  transition: opacity 1s;
}

::-webkit-input-placeholder {
  opacity: .4;
  -webkit-transition: opacity 1s;
  transition: opacity 1s;
}

:focus::-moz-placeholder {
  opacity: .2;
}

:focus:-ms-input-placeholder {
  opacity: .2;
}

:focus::-webkit-input-placeholder {
  opacity: .2;
}
```

## Features

#### Variables
  
  Using the same syntax as the [CSS spec](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-variables/). Just like future CSS, but without the cascade. Thanks to [`rework-vars`](https://github.com/visionmedia/rework-vars).

```css
:root {
  var-purple: #847AD1;
}

a {
  color: var(purple);
}
```

#### Math
  
  Using the same syntax as the [CSS spec](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#calc-notation). Just like future CSS, but without runtime interpolation. Thanks to [`rework-calc`](https://github.com/klei-dev/rework-calc).

```css
pre {
  margin: calc(50px * 2);
}
```

#### Color Manipulation
  
  Using the syntax as defined by [Tab Atkins's soon-to-be-proposed draft](http://rawgithub.com/tabatkins/specs/master/css-color/Overview.html#modifying-colors). Thanks to [`rework-color-function`](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/rework-color-function).

```css
a {
  color: #847AD1;
}

a:hover {
  color: color(#847AD1 tint(20%));
}
```

#### No Prefixes
  
  The prefixes from the most-common *and* most-recent browsers are supported, so you never need to worry about what the current browser support landscape is. Big thanks to [`autoprefixer`](https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer)!

```css
.button {
  background: linear-gradient(to bottom, black, white);
  transition: transform .25s;
}
```

#### And more...

* 4-digit and 8-digit hex color support. [`Spec`](http://rawgithub.com/tabatkins/specs/master/css-color/Overview.html#hex-notation) - [`Thanks`](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/rework-hex-alpha)
* Font-variant shorthands. [`Spec`](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-fonts/#font-variant-prop) - [`Thanks`](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/rework-font-variant)
