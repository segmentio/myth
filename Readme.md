# Myth


  _CSS the way it was imagined._

  Myth is a preprocessor that lets you write pure CSS without having to worry about slow browser support, or even slow spec approval. It's like a CSS polyfill.

  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/segmentio/myth.png)](http://travis-ci.org/segmentio/myth)

## Installation

    $ npm install -g myth

## Usage

    $ myth input.css output.css
    # Generated output.css from input.css

## Community

- [mnmly/builder-myth](https://github.com/mnmly/builder-myth): `component-builder` plugin
- [gulp-myth](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-myth): Gulp plugin
- [grunt-myth](https://github.com/sindresorhus/grunt-myth): Grunt plugin

## Why?

  Myth lets you write pure CSS while still giving you the benefits of tools like LESS and Sass. You can still use variables and math functions, just like you do in preprocessors. It's like a polyfill for future versions of the spec.

  Some of the features in CSS require runtime calculations, which neither Myth nor preprocessors handle, but what Myth does is let you write your code today in the future syntax, so that your code is future-proof. When browsers finally support these features you won't need to rewrite anything, just start using the cascade!

  Taking plain CSS as an input also means you can use Myth to <em>re-process</em> anyone else's CSS (or another preprocessors output), adding the browser support you need, without having to re-write the code in a completely different syntax.

  Myth is built with <a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/rework">Rework</a> so it's incredibly fast, and has a nice Javascript API in addition to the CLI.

## Example

  An example is the easiest way to explain it. If you write spec-compliant CSS:

```css
:root {
  --green: #a6c776;
}

@custom-media --narrow-window screen and (max-width: 30em);

@media (--narrow-window) {
  html {
    font-size: 1.2rem;
  }
}

a {
  color: var(--green);
  font-variant: all-small-caps;
  transition: color 1s;
}

a:hover {
  color: color(var(--green) shade(20%));
}

::placeholder {
  opacity: .4;
  transition: opacity 1s;
}

:focus::placeholder {
  opacity: .2;
}
```

  ... Myth will transform it for you, into browser-compliant CSS:

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 30em) {
  html {
    font-size: 1.2rem;
  }
}

a {
  color: #a6c776;
  -webkit-font-feature-settings: "smcp", "c2sc";
  -moz-font-feature-settings: "smcp", "c2sc";
  font-feature-settings: "smcp", "c2sc";
  font-variant: all-small-caps;
  -webkit-transition: color 1s;
  transition: color 1s;
}

a:hover {
  color: rgb(133, 159, 94);
}

::-webkit-input-placeholder {
  opacity: .4;
  -webkit-transition: opacity 1s;
  transition: opacity 1s;
}

::-moz-placeholder {
  opacity: .4;
  transition: opacity 1s;
}

:-ms-input-placeholder {
  opacity: .4;
  transition: opacity 1s;
}

::placeholder {
  opacity: .4;
  -webkit-transition: opacity 1s;
  transition: opacity 1s;
}

:focus::-webkit-input-placeholder {
  opacity: .2;
}

:focus::-moz-placeholder {
  opacity: .2;
}

:focus:-ms-input-placeholder {
  opacity: .2;
}

:focus::placeholder {
  opacity: .2;
}
```

## Features

#### Variables

  Using the same syntax as the [CSS spec](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-variables/). Just like future CSS, but without the cascade. Thanks to [`rework-vars`](https://github.com/visionmedia/rework-vars).

```css
:root {
  --purple: #847AD1;
}

a {
  color: var(--purple);
}
```

#### Math

  Using the same syntax as the [CSS spec](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#calc-notation). Just like future CSS, but without runtime interpolation. Thanks to [`rework-calc`](https://github.com/klei-dev/rework-calc).

```css
pre {
  margin: calc(50px * 2);
}
```

#### Custom media queries

  Using the same syntax as the [CSS spec](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/mediaqueries/#custom-mq). Thanks to [`rework-custom-media`](https://github.com/reworkcss/rework-custom-media).

```css
@custom-media --narrow-window (max-width: 30em);

@media (--narrow-window) {
  /* narrow window styles */
}

@media (--narrow-window) and (script) {
  /* special styles for when script is allowed */
}
```

#### Color Manipulation

  Using the same syntax as the [CSS spec](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-color/#modifying-colors). Thanks to [`rework-color-function`](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/rework-color-function).

```css
a {
  color: #847AD1;
}

a:hover {
  color: color(#847AD1 tint(20%));
}
```

#### No Prefixes

  The prefixes from the most-common *and* most-recent browsers are supported, so you never need to worry about what the current browser support landscape is. Big thanks to [`autoprefixer`](https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer)!

```css
.button {
  background: linear-gradient(to bottom, black, white);
  transition: transform .25s;
}
```

#### And more...

* 4-digit and 8-digit hex color support. [`Spec`](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-color/#hex-notation) - [`Thanks`](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/rework-hex-alpha)
* Font-variant shorthands. [`Spec`](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-fonts/#font-variant-prop) - [`Thanks`](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/rework-font-variant)

## API

#### Command Line

```
Usage: myth [<input>] [<output>]

Options:

  -c, --compress   compress the css output
  -h, --help       output usage information
  -v, --verbose    log verbose output for debugging
  -V, --version    output the version number
  -w, --watch      watch the input file for changes

Examples:

  # pass an input and output file:
  $ myth input.css output.css

  # watch the input file for changes:
  $ myth --watch input.css output.css

  # unix-style piping to stdin and stdout:
  $ cat input.css | myth | grep background-color
```

#### Node.js

```js
var myth = require('myth');
var fs = require('fs');

var css = fs.readFileSync('index.css', 'utf8');
var converted = myth(css);

fs.writeFileSync('converted.css', converted);
```

  Or use it directly as a Rework plugin:

```js
var myth = require('myth');
var rework = require('rework');
var fs = require('fs');

var css = fs.readFileSync('index.css', 'utf8');
var converted = rework(css)
  .use(myth())
  .toString();

fs.writeFileSync('converted.css', converted);
```

  Options:

  - `browsers` - `Array` - an array of [browsers and versions to support](https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer#browsers).
  - `compress` - `Boolean` - whether to compress the CSS output.
  - `features` - `Object` - list of features to enable/disable. By default all features are enabled.
  - `source` - `String` - the full path to the source CSS file. This is necessary if you want Myth to concatenate `@import` rules in your CSS.
